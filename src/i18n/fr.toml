[safetyDetail]
other = '''
Risankizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. 
Risankizumab may increase the risk of infection. In patients with a chronic infection, a history of recurrent infection, 
or known risk factors for infection, risankizumab should be used with caution. Treatment with risankizumab should not 
be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately 
treated. Prior to initiating treatment with risankizumab, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. 
Patients receiving risankizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be 
considered prior to initiating risankizumab in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate 
course of treatment cannot be confirmed.

Prior to initiating therapy with risankizumab, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be considered 
according to current immunisation guidelines. If a patient has received live vaccination (viral or bacterial), 
it is recommended to wait at least 4 weeks prior to starting treatment with risankizumab. Patients treated with 
risankizumab should not receive live vaccines during treatment and for at least 21 weeks after treatment.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions were upper respiratory infections, which occurred in 13% of patients.
Commonly (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) reported adverse reactions included tinea infections, headache, pruritus, fatigue and 
injection site reactions.
